1. What data types do each of these values represent?

"A Clockwork Orange" => string
42 => integer
09/02/1945 => date

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: A database is useful whenever you want your data to persist application sessions, or are dealing with large amounts
of data that will be accessed frequently and possibly by multiple users at the same time. A text file would be
appropriate if the data needs to read by people as opposed to just the application.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: The main difference is that SQL is declarative as opposed to procedural. This allows us to abstract away the specifics
of the database operation and "phrase" our queries and operations in a way that is more similar to verbal language than
procedural programming.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: The general structure is very similar to a spreadsheet; the whole thing is set up as a table with values contained
in cells. Each column represents a different category of values generally of the same data type, while each row represents
a complete entry so to speak; i.e. each row is a unique user with each column being a different type of data associated with
each user.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: The table is the whole set of data values and labels. Each row represents a complete set of data while each column
represents a different category of data. The data is stored in the cells of the table as values.

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: string, float, integer
